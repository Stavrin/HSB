where does it set what damagetype amount is for each
if is blocking less damage for each

need to do Blocking bool in animator.
need to turn blood back on

added blocking, made heavy attack do double damage.

in full screen fight looks fine,
but select screen needs stuff on right brought to middle.

animation override or whatever its called.

just as a feature they have different style blocks lol
so weird.

how put image in git readme, prb have to put file on git first.
now that i got it in 1080p view, fix the issues. make grid just the size it needs to be.

p1 x -2.6 y 0.02844228 z -7.2
